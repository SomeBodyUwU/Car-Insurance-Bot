#  Car Insurance Telegram Bot
A simple project with a mock Mindee API request(for now) and usage of Open AI API to support real-like answers from the bot side.
## Setting-up
-In order to have a bot working properly, consider adding environmental variables to your local machine named "CARINSURANCEBOT_TELEGRAM_API_KEY" and "CARINSURANCEBOT_OPENAI_API_KEY". You can use Open AI help page to do that: https://help.openai.com/en/articles/5112595-best-practices-for-api-key-safety
